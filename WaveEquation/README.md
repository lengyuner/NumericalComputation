The computaional solution of the simplest wave eqution 

Here we use five methods to compute the wave eqution
u_{t}+a u_{x}=0

We assume that ' a>0 ' and adopt '\nu a=\fran{1}{2}'
\nu=\fran{\delta t}{\delta x}

'a' is the wave spread.

the following is the five methods：
1. upwind scheme
2. LW scheme
3. Lax scheme
4. Frag Leaping scheme
5. Box scheme




Finally, we adopt the median filter to improve the computaional outcomes.

The improvement is distinct.
You can see it in the picture.
Very interesting!
